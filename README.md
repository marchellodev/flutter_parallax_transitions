# About
This package is a fork of [flutter_page_transition](https://github.com/handoing/flutter_page_transition), migrated to Null-Safety, and with implemented linter suggestions.

This was done to preserve the Parallax effect, which I was not able to find in other packages, and was too dumb to implement myself.

Also I have changed a few things added a new transition type: `PageSliding`.

Please refer to `exameple/main.dart` and the original package for documentation.
